<ul><li><strong>New research suggests that the Mediterranean diet and adherence to related dietary recommendations showed no significant association with a reduced risk of dementia.</strong></li><li><strong>Previous studies have shown mixed results on the effects of the Mediterranean diet and dementia risk.</strong></li><li><strong>While there are many health benefits of following a Mediterranean eating pattern, it is not the only factor to take into consideration when it comes to reducing your risk for dementia.</strong></li></ul>

<p>The Mediterranean diet is a healthy, mostly plant-based eating style, which includes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats, such as fish and olive oil. The&nbsp;<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-diets-overall" target="_blank">U.S. World and News Report</a></em>&nbsp;has ranked the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan">Mediterranean diet</a>&nbsp;as the best diet in the world for 5 consecutive years.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that people who follow healthful eating patterns such as the Mediterranean diet may have a reduced risk of dementia.</p>

<p>But a new study suggests that the Mediterranean diet may not be linked to a reduced risk of dementia after all.</p>

<p>The research, published today in the online issue of the journal&nbsp;<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2022/10/12/WNL.0000000000201336" target="_blank">Neurology</a></em>, examined 28,000 participants from Sweden over a 20-year period.</p>

<p>Participants had an average age of 58 and did not have dementia at the start of the study. They filled out a weekly food diary, and a food frequency questionnaire, and participated in an interview. At the conclusion of the study, 1,943 people, or nearly 7%, were diagnosed with dementia, which included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alzheimers-disease">Alzheimer’s disease (AD)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dementia/vascular-dementia">vascular dementia</a>.</p>

<p>“While our study does not rule out a possible association between diet and dementia, we did not find a link in our study, which had a long follow-up period, included younger participants than some other studies, and did not require people to remember what foods they had eaten regularly years before,” study author Dr.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lucat/user/ebe2a6e4fba9c7621c772cd665ae4186" target="_blank">Isabelle Glans</a>, research and doctoral student at Lund University in Sweden, said in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newswise.com/articles/does-the-mediterranean-diet-really-decrease-your-risk-of-dementia?sc=dwhr&amp;xy=10049345" target="_blank">news release</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the new findings, however, study authors noted that further research is still needed.</p>
