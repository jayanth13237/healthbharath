<p>Parkinson’s is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/statistics#:~:text=Nearly%20one%20million%20people%20in,diagnosed%20with%20PD%20each%20year." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second most common neurodegenerative disease</a>&nbsp;after Alzheimer’s, according to the Parkinson’s Foundation.</p>

<p>Yet, the vast majority of the 60,000 people in the United States diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/parkinsons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parkinson’s disease</a>&nbsp;each year don’t know they have the disease until they have already started exhibiting symptoms.</p>

<p>A new test, however, could potentially lead to earlier detection and treatment of Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>Past research has shown that elevated levels of sebum, an oily secretion from the sebaceous glands under the skin, can serve as a marker for Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>Sebum is part of a class of high molecular weight lipids that are more prevalent among people with Parkinson’s, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacsau.2c00300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a study</a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the study, researchers from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom used cotton swabs to gather samples of sebum from the skin.</p>

<p>Using mass spectrometry, scientists were able to analyze the samples to identify individuals at high risk of Parkinson’s within 3 minutes.</p>
